Hello, curious soul! I’m Arianne, a passionate learner and problem-solver. 
<br><br>  
As a Business Analyst at Hydro One, I am working on Windows 11 Migration, data analytics, and IT operations. In winter, I will join TELUS as an RAN Standards team intern. I've worked at Blackberry, Karla Rewards, and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. I’m also learning more about AI by taking a course at York University and <a href="https://curius.app/arianne-ghislaine-rull/computer-science">reading research papers</a>, further fueling my passion for technology.
<br><br>
At Blackberry, I developed internal tools and data visualization dashboards. At Karla Rewards, I contributed to designing their website and mobile app. At Sunnybrook, I created a web control interface for a digital acquisition system. My research experience includes working with the University of Toronto’s Cobweb Lab, where I helped build a model studying aging farmers in the Philippines.
<br><br>
During my free time, you’ll find me reading research papers or books, hiking through nature, painting for fun, indulging in matcha treats, and exploring the art galleries and outdoors. 
<br><br>
I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations. You can contact me at arianneghislaine@gmail.com
