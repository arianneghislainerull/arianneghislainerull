Hi there! 👋 I’m Arianne, an aspiring <b>Data & Machine Learning Engineer</b> and Computer Science student with hands-on experience building data pipelines, analytics systems, and production-facing ML solutions.  

Most recently, I worked at <b>TELUS</b> across teams, where I:
<ul>
  <li>Deployed time-series forecasting frameworks in <b>BigQuery ML</b> (ARIMA+) to predict network traffic trends used for capacity planning</li>
  <li>Built and maintained <b>Looker dashboards</b> backed by <b>BigQuery pipelines</b>, improving stakeholder visibility into forecast accuracy, traffic trends, and capacity risks</li>
  <li>Automated <b>ETL workflows</b> using <b>SQL</b> and <b>Python</b> to streamline ingestion and processing</li>
  <li>Developed data products and tools for real-time and historical tracking across thousands of sites</li>
  <li>Won <b>1st place</b> in multiple TELUS hackathons for data/AI solutions</li>
</ul>

I bring <a href="https://github.com/arianneghislainerull/readme-experience">2+ years of professional experience in technical roles</a> across data engineering, analytics, and software engineering. I enjoy translating complex requirements into reliable systems, deploying ML-driven insights, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver measurable impact.
